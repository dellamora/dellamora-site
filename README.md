My portfolio website is a hub that showcases my programming articles, work experiences, and public projects and provides a clear overview of my skills. It serves as a personal hub, making it easy to find and access relevant information about me and my work, as well as how to contact me for potential job opportunities or collaborations. Whether you're seeking programming insights or looking for a new project to explore, my portfolio website has everything you need.

On the technical side, I used TypeScript, Next.js to make the site work with SSR, Framer Motion to create the animations, and React-Query to fetch my articles.
