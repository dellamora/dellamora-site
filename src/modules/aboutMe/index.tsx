            My passion for computers began when I was a child and used my
            father&apos;s computer to play games. Over the years I learned how
            to create themes on the Tumblr platform and I consider it a
            milestone in my choice of profession, since I was messing around
            with HTML and CSS and got enchanted with the web universe.
            Currently, I have over 2 years of experience working in the software
            development industry, seeking efficiency in developing ideas and
            turning them into reality, bringing smart solutions to challenges
            and adversities.
